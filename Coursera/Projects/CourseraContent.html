    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
    <h3 id="HyperText">HyperText</h3>
    Basically just text that links to other text
    <h3 id="Markup Language">Markup Language</h3>
    Language wrapped around the content that tells the computer about the nature of the content.
    <h3 id="HTML, CSS, JS">HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT</h3>
    Each file provide respectively the Structure, the Style and the Behavior(functions) of the website.
    <br>Notice: because of the nature of HTML, everything in it serves the purpose of structuring, inlcuding the the
    heading tags.
    <h3 id="Bit of history">Bit of history</h3>
    Real origin of the current HTML:5 :WHATWG:HTML + W3C:XML
    <p>WHATWG constantly improves HTML, while W3C decides which of the improvements will become
      the official standards(HTML5)
      <a href="https://caniuse.com/" target="_blank"> A link to check which browsers has adopted an attribute </a>
    </p>
    <h3 id="Tags">Tags</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> The !DOCTYPE html at the top of the html file is a declaration exclusive to HTML5. Without it, the browser
        enter quirks mode.</li>
      <li> Like the Doctype tag, the title tag is also essential.</li>
      <li> The viewport is refering to the body tag.</li>
      <li> Something to remember: Html renders from top to bottom, sequentially.</li>
      <li> Meta tags communicate information to the browser. </li>
      <li> Div is a block element, hence even if it is followed by a span element, the div will push the span to a new
        line.
        Also the reason why you can't have a div inside span. The same goes for p element...
      <li> Pragraph tag, header and heading tags aswell as footer tags are all block level elements. The main reason of
        specifying instead of using div everywhere is to structurize the codes. Those are called semantic elements</li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="Lists">Lists</h3>
    Ordered(ol) and unordered(ul) lists with list item(li). Within a list, there can only be list items. It is posible
    to have a list within a list item.
    <h3>Character Entity</h3>
    <p>Serves the purpose of preventing redering issues, basically replacing a special character with some other one.
    </p>
    Characters to avoid: &lt;, &gt; and &amp; as they can cause confusion when interpreted by the computer. Instead, use
    & lt , & gt and & amp(withouth the space inbetween) respectively to represent those characters.
    A special one to remember is the copyright symbol &copy;, denoted by & copy.
    <p>
      Let's say I want some words to always stay on the same line, replace the space between the desired words with
      entity & nbsp which stands for None Breaking Space
    </p>
    <h3 id="Links">Links</h3>
    The a tag creats a hyperlink(href = hypertext reference) to either an internal or external link. For external links,
    it's suggested to add a target=_blank inside the starting tag so when the link is clicked, it appears in a new
    window.
    <p>The a element is both inline and block at the same time. This allows the a tag to have a div within it, meaning
      one is not obliged to click on the text but rather in the surrounding region to access the link.</p>
    <p>Another feature of this element is to navigate within the same page. First an Id must be assigned to the
      designated sections, then creat a list in the following format:
      &lt;li&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a&nbsp;href="#designated&nbsp;section"&gt;#Designated&nbsp;Section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; *Of
      course, it doesn't necessarily have to be a list, any blcok element would work. </p>
    <div>
      <h4>Example:<a href="#TOP">Back to top</a></h4>
    </div>
    <p>This feature(fragment identifier) changes the URl, hence it could be used as a bookmark when sending to someone. It brings them right to the designated section.</p>
